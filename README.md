This mod is based on the Show Skill XP Gain

The basics are there, except the Mod Options addon.

Features:
- Shows the sum of all XP, per perk, all together, instead of all of them separately.
- Shows negative values, just in case there is lost in a perk's XP, it will show in red and with a inverted triangle.
- Added a selector to hide all Modded XP gains, as well as Vanilla XP gains.
- Optimized the code.
- Removed Foraging as a Skill to show the XP Gain.
- Added the option to show only the gain of the skill, without the value.
