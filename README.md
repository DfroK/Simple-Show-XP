This mod is based on the Show Skill XP Gain

The basics are there, except the Mod Options addon.

Features:
- Shows the sum of all XP, per perk, all together, instead of all of them separately.
- Shows negative values, just in case there is lost in a perk's XP, it will show in red and with a inverted triangle.

The Mod Options addon was not added just yet, but it will be added.
