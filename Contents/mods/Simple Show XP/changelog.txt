V0.1.2:

- The skills that are too fast for the text shower (It takes like 3 seconds with the text floating) will now wait 300 ticks to show the text again, making even cleaner the showing of XP.
- Also added a check that will show XP with a value higher than 0.01, as sometimes the gain is lower than that.

TODO:
- Add Mod Options synergy
